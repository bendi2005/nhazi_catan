Preset loading:
In Gameboard() check if preset is empty, if it is create it there, and take it from there.

std::vector<Coordinate> SearchDirection 
This might appear as being the exact same thing that Tile::NodePos, thats because it is.
However it serves a logically different purpose, hence its not double code.
This solution also dismisses the need for a way to access Tile::NodePos 
(which would be unwanted, either messing up single responsibility or having to fiddle with access)
